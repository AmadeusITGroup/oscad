What do I have to do for using my open source software compliantly,
if 
<ol>
<li>I do not handover any of the software package to any 3rd. party
in any sense AND</li>
<li>none of the software packages is licensed under the AGPL AND</li>
<li>I do not modify any of the used open source software before
using it AND</li>
<li>each piece of software is licensed under an open source license
which has already been checked by the OSLiC (Apache-2.0, BSD 2CL, BSD 3CL, EPL 1.0, 
EUPL 1.1, GPL 2.0, GPL 3.0, LGPL 2.1, LGPL 3.0, MIT, MPL 2.0,

For each piece of open source software you want to use, the OSCAd 
would answer that you do not have to do anything; and for some 
of these pieces of open source software the OSCAd would add that
you must respect some interdictions. So, if you respect all 
the following postulations for each piece of open source 
software you want to use you are using 
the open source software compliantly.
